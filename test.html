  <h1>Terms and Conditons of OPENEYE</h1>
  <p>
    By using Openeye, you agree to the following terms and conditions: Openeye is an app that scans users' pictures and employs web engines to continuously, hourly, or daily search for these images on social media platforms. If Openeye detects pictures not posted by the user, it will send a notification stating, "This picture has been detected, it has been circulated 15 times (for example). Do you want to block it? If you block it, the content will not be shared anymore." Users who choose to block content acknowledge that Openeye will take reasonable steps to prevent further sharing, although complete removal from all platforms cannot be guaranteed. Users are responsible for providing accurate information and maintaining the confidentiality of their accounts. Openeye disclaims all warranties and is not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from the use of the app. The use of Openeye is subject to our Privacy Policy, and we reserve the right to modify these terms at any time with notice. For any questions, please contact us at [your contactÂ information].
